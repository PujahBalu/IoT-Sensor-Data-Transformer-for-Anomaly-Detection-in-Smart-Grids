# IoT Sensor Data Transformer for Anomaly Detection in Smart Grids

## 🧠 Goal
Use transformer-based models to detect anomalies in smart meter sensor data for smart grid monitoring.

## 📊 Dataset
[Smart Meter Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeanmidev/smart-meter-energy-consumption)

## 🔧 Tools & Frameworks
- PyTorch
- SHAP
- Matplotlib
- Time Series Transformer
- Google Colab

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with full code
- `docs/`: Project document
- `images/`: Sample output visualizations

## 📝 Tasks
- Adapt transformer for time-series anomaly detection
- Evaluate performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall
- Apply SHAP for model explainability
